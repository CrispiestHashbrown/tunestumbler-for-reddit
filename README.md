## Getting started
Clone the application yourself:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/CrispiestHashbrown/tunestumbler-for-reddit.git
```
Navigate to project directory and install dependencies:
```
npm install
```
Starting the project locally:
```
npm start
```
To run unit tests:
```
npm test
```


## Usage
- This web application is designed to work with the [Tunestumbler API](https://github.com/CrispiestHashbrown/tunestumbler-wrapper-for-reddit). It also requires you to login to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) to be able to create filters from your subscribed Subreddits. 

- Reddit tokens expire every hour, and the website attempts to automatically refresh the token.

- To set any filters, you must be subscribed to at least one Subreddit.

- There are no ads.

- This has only been tested on Chrome web browser and Windows 10. 

## Future development
- The plan is to treat the filtered results as playlists that will feed into Youtube and Spotify browser extensions to make finding new music more convenient.

## Contributions
- Contribution process is not decided yet... but any improvements are welcome!
