## Getting started
Clone the application yourself:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/CrispiestHashbrown/tunestumbler-for-reddit.git
```
Navigate to project directory and install dependencies:
```
npm install
```
Starting the project locally:
```
npm start
```
To run unit tests:
```
npm test
```


## Usage
- This web application only works the the Reddit API. It requires you to login to Reddit to be able to use your subscribed Subreddits.

- To set any filters, you must be subscribed to at least one Subreddit.

- There are no ads.

- This has only been tested on Chrome web browser and Windows 10. 

## Future development
- The plan is to treat the filtered results as playlists that will feed into Youtube and Spotify browser extensions to make finding new music more convenient.

## Contributions
- Improvements are welcome
